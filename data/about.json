    "Belgium&rsquo;s commitment to transparency is enshrined in <strong>Article 32 of the Constitution</strong>, which guarantees every person the right to consult any administrative document and to obtain a copy, except in cases and conditions stipulated by law. This constitutional provision forms the bedrock of all FOI legislation in the country.",
    "The federal FOI law was adopted in <strong>1994</strong> (Loi relative &agrave; la publicit&eacute; de l&rsquo;administration / Wet openbaarheid van bestuur), establishing a formal framework for citizens to request access to administrative documents. Each region and community has subsequently adopted its own complementary legislation, creating a layered system of transparency obligations across the country.",
    "Belgium&rsquo;s federal structure adds considerable complexity to FOI implementation. The country comprises <strong>3 communities</strong> (French, Flemish, and German-speaking), <strong>3 regions</strong> (Wallonia, Flanders, and Brussels-Capital), <strong>10 provinces</strong>, and <strong>581 municipalities</strong>. Each level of government operates under its own FOI regime, with varying degrees of compliance, resources, and institutional culture. The general statutory deadline for responding to an FOI request is <strong>30 days</strong>, although extensions are possible in specific circumstances."
